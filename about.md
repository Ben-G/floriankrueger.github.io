.. born and grown up in Berlin, moved south to Bavaria later, [studied](http://www.dhbw-stuttgart.de "DHBW Stuttgart") applied computer science in Stuttgart, now [working](http://www.gutefrage.net "my employer") and enjoying life in Munich.

Always curious for new technologies and better ways of doing what already has been done you might find me in random [networks](http://github.com/floriankrueger "my github profile"), projects, [platforms](http://stackoverflow.com/users/766873/florian-k "stackoverflow") and [communities](http://eurucamp.org "eurucamp") related or unrelated to stuff that can be solved using software.

When not in front of some kind of screen we'll possibly meet somewhere on the streets or in the woods running or dirtbiking, during the cold time of the year more likely in the alps riding snowboards.

Aim high, be aware you might fail, learn - and try again. Live, love and enjoy because that's what its all about.
